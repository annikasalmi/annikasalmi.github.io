Hi! I'm Annika Salmi. I am currently pursuing my MPhil in Planetary Sciences and Life in the Universe at Trinity Hall, University of Cambridge. I’m interested in using my simulation engineering background to model planetary atmospheres.

I previously worked as a simulation engineer at Starfish Space, modeling the physics of drag. I’m a Yale University graduate in Astronomy and Physics. I grew up in San Francisco, Barcelona, and Zurich, and previously lived in Seattle, Washington.

I’m also interested science communication; I have taught astronomy & physics to youth and also have written numerous popular science articles.
