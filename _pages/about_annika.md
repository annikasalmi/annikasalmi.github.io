Hi! I'm Annika Salmi. I am currently pursuing a PhD at ETH Zurich across three departments (Physics, Earth and Planetary Sciences, and Environmental Systems Science). I am currently working on modelling carbon and sulfur cycles on exoplanets.

I previously completed a Master's in Planetary Science at Trinity Hall, Cambridge, and worked as a simulation engineer at Starfish Space, modeling the physics of drag. I’m a Yale University graduate in Astronomy and Physics. I grew up in San Francisco, Barcelona, and Zurich, and previously lived in Seattle, Washington.

I’m also interested in science communication; I have taught astronomy & physics to youth and also have written numerous popular science articles.
