    - title: Simulation Engineer
      institution: Starfish Space
      year: 2022-2024
      description:
        - Wrote the company tool that uses on-orbit data to find the current location of the satellite in orbit. Used this tool to determine physics simulation accuracy; found the simulation was already 95% accurate.
        - Modeled low Earth orbit physics in a Basilisk physics simulation to solve for drag. Obtained a value for coefficient of drag lower than accepted literature value of 2.2.
        - Added hot pixels, cosmic rays, and blurring to synthetic Blender satellite images to train the navigation model. Created thousands of images as part of this iterative process.
        - Architected and wrote a pipeline to process and clean on-orbit data for ground analysis.
        - Improved dynamics simulation model performance by 30%, by rewriting slow algorithms, by tailoring cloud tools, and changing build processes. Dynamics simulation is Python wrapping C++ code; contributed in both languages. Also improved simulation UI for everyone who interacted with the simulation.
    - title: Research Assistant
      institution: Urry Lab, Yale University
      year: 2020-2021
      description:
        - Mapped galaxy dust distributions of 109 galaxies with active galactic nuclei (AGN) to resolve whether whether dust obscured X-ray radiation from the AGN.
        - Wrote an algorithm that combined infrared and optical Hubble images to illuminate the galactic dust.
        - Established a GitHub package that when installed, creates attenuation (dust) maps of galaxies.
        - Presented at a senior thesis Mellon Forum; funded by the Richter Memorial Fund.

    - title: Research Assistant
      institution: Newburgh Lab, Yale University
      year: 2019-2020
      description:
        - Generated channel telescope frequency versus intensity graphs of well-known bright stars on the Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment (CHIME) to find telescope accuracy. Found 5 frequency channels that were over- and under-measuring intensity; results calibrated telescope.
        - Research done with Cedar supercomputer; funded by the Richter Memorial Fund.
